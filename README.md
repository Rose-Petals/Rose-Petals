üå∏ Hi! My name is Fnu and I am a third year CS student at the University of Texas at Dallas. My passion for computer science started after taking a couple of classes in high school which was then amplified during COVID, I realized the vast world that was at my disposal even when I was stuck at home and unable to go outside. I am a current student at University of Texas at Dallas where I am getting a B.S in Computer Science. I am passionate about using technology to help people and spread accessibility in a way that wasn't possible before. My involvement in Women Mentoring Women during my college career has inspired me to make greater and bolder strides and to use the unique perspective that being a woman makes me as an advantage. I am invested in making tech an open space that allows anyone to express themselves as they wish.

### ‚öôÔ∏è My main tech stack include: Java, Python, C++, and some Javascript. I am familiar with using Matlab, Scikit, and NumPy.
